        </h3>
        <p>
          As an enthusiastic front-end developer, I love any opportunity to be <i>Creative</i> and enjoy <i>Challenge</i>. I am always <i>Curious</i> of how things work and never afraid to ask why. I am extremely passionate about furthering my skills and building <i>Innovative</i> and <i>Simple</i> solutions in a collaborative and supportive environment.
        </p>
        <p>My goal as a developer is to be the bridge between design and technology that can turn an idea into an interactive app that is visually-pleasing, yet functional and accessible technology for every person in the world.</p>
        <p>When I am free, I love exploring good food around town, building lego blocks, learning new recipes, playing sports and watching movies.</p>
